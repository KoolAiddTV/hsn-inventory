# Info
hsn is no longer supporting the inventory and has put it on the back burner. I'm attempting to fix any major issues with it. This should work 100% and have no issues. Please report anything that comes up and I'll attempt to fix it. 

Thanks for the inventory hsn.

Add this code ghmattimysql server.lua

exports("ready", function (callback)
  Citizen.CreateThread(function ()
      -- add some more error handling
      while GetResourceState('ghmattimysql') ~= 'started' do
          Citizen.Wait(0)
      end
      callback()
  end)
end)
Should look like:
